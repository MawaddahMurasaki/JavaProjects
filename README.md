Basic Android application

The code in this repository is the main code for an Android application called Position.

The application is an Indoor Positioning application. The location is calculated using database stored in the application. 

Before using the application, the desired building needs to be trained by storing WiFi signal strength in the database. 

The location would be determined by matching the current WiFi strength with the data stored in the application.
